# SCCM-MECM-DELETE-PCS

PowerShell script to delete a computer device from Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM/SCCM).

## üìã Description
This script automates the removal of devices from SCCM using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) queries.

Useful for cleaning up old or duplicate devices in the SCCM database.

## üß† Requirements

- SCCM PowerShell module (run the script from the MECM server or console).
- Administrative rights on MECM/SCCM.
- PowerShell 5.1 or later.

## üöÄ Usage

```powershell
.\delete-sccm-computer.ps1 -ComputerName "DEVICE-NAME"
```

## üõ† Example command used:

```powershell
$resource = Get-WmiObject -Namespace "root\SMS\site_<YourSiteCode>" -Query "SELECT * FROM SMS_R_System WHERE Name = 'DEVICE-NAME'"
$resource | ForEach-Object {
    Remove-WmiObject -InputObject $_
}
```

‚úÖ Replace `<YourSiteCode>` with your actual SCCM site code (e.g., "PRI", "L01", etc.).

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety
This script includes error handling and will skip if the device is not found.  
You can add logging for audit purposes.
